Note on installing dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In principle, if you are using :code:`pip`, you don't have to install
dependencies beforehand. When you install this package, :code`pip` will
automatically install the required libraries. However if you are using Conda
it is best to use its own package manager and not pip unless absolutely
necessary.

If you use conda:

.. code:: bash

   conda install -c conda-forge package1 package2

Now, let's say package 3 is not available, then we can use pip. But,
be sure to use :code:`which pip` to check if we are using the pip installed
on the conda environment and not the global one.

.. code:: bash

   pip install package3

Install from source
-------------------

.. code:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/terrencetec/mypythonlibrary.git
   cd mypythonlibrary
   pip install .
